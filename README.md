# Hi there 👋

I'm a developer focusing on building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance AI assistant capabilities. My work enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with various services and APIs, making them more practical and powerful for real-world applications.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [NS Travel Information MCP Server](https://github.com/r-huijts/ns-mcp-server)
An MCP server that provides real-time access to Dutch Railways (NS) travel information through AI assistants. This integration enables:
- Real-time train schedule queries
- Travel disruption notifications
- Journey planning assistance

### [Canvas LMS MCP Server](https://github.com/r-huijts/canvas-mcp)
A comprehensive MCP server for Canvas Learning Management System integration, featuring:
- Course management tools
- Assignment and submission handling
- Student data analysis
