# 👋 Hello, AI Adventurers!

I'm a developer, educator, and author building bridges between powerful AI and the everyday tools people actually use. My mission? Making AI assistants not just smarter, but friendlier and genuinely helpful through the magic of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I believe in human-centered technology – solutions shaped by real needs, not just flashy features. Beyond my coding adventures, I teach ICT at Fontys Hogeschool, specializing in user interaction, iOS development, software engineering, and generative AI. I'm also the author of "Leven en Leren met AI," a study book helping students navigate and responsibly apply generative AI in their learning journeys.
