# Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate educator, author, and developer on a mission to make AI assistants not just smarter, but friendlier and genuinely helpful. By crafting Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, I'm building bridges that connect powerful AI to everyday tools and services people actually love to use. My passion lies in human-centered technology: solutions shaped by real needs, not just flashy features.

Beyond coding, I teach ICT at Fontys Hogeschool, specializing in user interaction, iOS development, software engineering, and generative AI. I've also authored "Leven en Leren met AI," a study book helping students navigate and responsibly apply generative AI in their learning journeys.
