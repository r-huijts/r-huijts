# Hi there 👋

I'm a developer passionate about making AI assistants more human-friendly and accessible. By building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, I create bridges between AI and everyday services that people actually use. My focus is on making technology serve real human needs, not just technical possibilities.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
