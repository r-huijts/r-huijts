# Hi there 👋

I'm a developer passionate about making AI assistants more human-friendly and accessible. By building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, I create bridges between AI and everyday services that people actually use. My focus is on making technology serve real human needs, not just technical possibilities.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Bringing the power of AI assistance directly into Xcode:
- Seamless integration with development workflow
- Natural language interaction with Xcode projects
- Smart code analysis and suggestions
- Project management through conversation

### [NS Travel Information MCP Server](https://github.com/r-huijts/ns-mcp-server)
Making train travel easier by letting people ask AI assistants natural questions about their journey:
- "When's my next train home?"
- Real-time updates about delays and platform changes
- Simple journey planning in everyday language

### [Canvas LMS MCP Server](https://github.com/r-huijts/canvas-mcp)
